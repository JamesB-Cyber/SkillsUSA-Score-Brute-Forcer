# WARNING
This project uses multiple libraries not built into python and need to be installed using pip
One of the libraries "simple-term-menu" is NOT built for windows and will not work on windows nor the windows sub-system for linux.
This will be modified to use a different terminal UI however most are not compatible with windows commandline or powershell.
